DOCTYPE <html lang = "en">
<div class = "download">
<a href = {{url_for('download')}} target = "blank"> <button class = "btn"> Download</button></a>
</div>
</html>

the url_for bit of the code looks for a function in python that is called 'download'. This page wont be renderable unless we have a function called
download in the python file
